# Simple-CNN-Guide
This is a practical guide for building [*Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), and it applies to beginners who like to know how to start building a CNN with *Pytorch*.
In this guide I will explain the steps to write code for basic CNN, with link to relevant to topics. The reader sould have basic knowledge of [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) for him to use it.

### The Network & The Database
The network in this guide is a 6 layers network contains: 2 convolution layers, 2 pooling layers and 2 fully-connected layers. The network also applies dropout and batch-normalization methods.
#### MNIST Database
This network is trained on MNIST dataset, a simple gray-scale images of a writen one-digit numbers (0-9), such that the network gets an image and it's target to classify it as the correct number (class).
