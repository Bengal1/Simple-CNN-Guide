# Simple-CNN-Guide
This is a practical guide for building [*Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), and it applies to beginners who like to know how to start building a CNN with *Pytorch*.
In this guide I will explain the steps to write code for basic CNN, with link to relevant to topics. The reader sould have basic knowledge of [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) for him to use it.
